# goobar
A custom (not for you) status bar info feed thing that integrates with LemonBar

## Description
Think [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) but uses
[LemonBar](https://github.com/trevarj/lemonbar-xft) as a backend. Basically,
it's a bunch of "scripts" that pipe into stdin of lemonbar.

It is not configurable at the moment and only has a few modules.

## Modules 
- [x] bspwm  
- [x] datetime  
- [x] ethernet status  
- [x] cpu/mem usage
- [ ] weather
- [ ] sound
- [ ] X keyboard layout
- [ ] systemtray (external?)
- [ ] custom modules
